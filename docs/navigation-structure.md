## Connect your app with the ClearDB database

Once you have **created** clearDB for your database, we can now connect our app with the ClearDB database. Refer to the top of your Heroku application page, 
in the menu section, **click** _Settings_.




Arriving at the Settings page, **find** the Config Vars (configurations variables) section below the application information. Then **click** _Reveal Config Vars_ to show the details




Sometimes configuration variables can be links and are too long for the section bar. **Find** the configuration that says _CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL_, and **click** the _pencil icon_ on the right to open up more details on the configuration.

After you open up the details, you should **see** the contents of your _CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL_ value
<span style="color:red">The value in red circle, represents user</spannnnn>
<span style="color:blue">The value in blue circle, represents password</span>
<span style="color:green">The value in green circle, represents host</span>
<span style="color:yellow">The value in black circle, represents database</span>
