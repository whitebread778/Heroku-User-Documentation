In this document, we are going to be learning how to create an app on Heroku **properly**. Creating an app sets the foundation for all of our work. So we need to be sure that this part is perfect.

**1.** Open Heroku

***
**2.** Click **New**

*** 
**3.** Click **Create new app**

***
**4.** Enter the name of your app, then **Create the app**  
***

If we have followed these steps correctly, we should have a new page that displays our app names, and various options below it. Good job! We now have an app.
