# Overview of Heroku User Documentation
This document will guide you through how to use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to build an app running on Heroku
The goal of this documentation is to provide new web development learner steps about how to deploy your code to Heroku.
These are the steps of this document
1. Create new app
2. Deploy your code to Github
3. Setting up clearDB for your app
4. Connect your app with the ClearDB database

## How we created this guide
We created this guide from the knowledge we learned from web database course. There are several steps from having web code locally to have a real URL which allows other people to access to the website. We organized the steps so that our users can have clear instructions

## Methods
### Just the Docs
We chose to use [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) as our site generator. Because the goal for this documentation is to make the steps clear and simple for the users, we choose this scheme to make our documentation neat.
